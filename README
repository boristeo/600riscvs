lightmetal - flatbuffer capture and replay of traces!!!

plan of action:
1) try to turn loopback example into lightmetal flatbuf
2) verify that it runs, find minimum amount of their library necessary (device enumeration, running flatbuf)
3) inspect flatbuf internals, find kernel, try to recreate from scratch.
4) verify that my kernel functionally identical
5) repeat 3,4 for increasingly more complex metal programs (two kernels, using accel, etc)
